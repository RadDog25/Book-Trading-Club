# Book-Trading-Club

A personal project with functionality inspired by the Free Code Camp project (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club), and UI based on Netflix (loosely).

Built on SCSS / Vue / Node - Express.js / MongoDB - Mongoose

To get the project running you will need to:
1) Create a MongoDB database.
2) Create a config.js file appropriate to your database, using the configexample.js as a reference
3) run `npm install` at root and public directories
4) run `npm run dev` at root and public directories (root for express, public for vue hot reloading)
5) The project should be available at localhost:8080
